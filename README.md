CS-330 Final 3D scene with lighting, textures, and camera navigation.
How do I approach designing software?
•	I begin by visualizing the end-user experience and planning the layout and proportions of objects before writing any code.
•	This project helped me strengthen spatial reasoning and visual design, especially in placing objects realistically within a 3D environment.
•	I followed an iterative design process: place objects → test camera views → adjust proportions → refine lighting and textures.
•	These same tactics — visual planning, modular thinking, and iterative refinement will be valuable in future UI/UX and front-end development work.

How do I approach developing programs?
•	I write modular, organized, and readable code so that each part of the system is easy to maintain and extend.
•	For this 3D scene, I reused existing utility functions instead of rewriting logic and centralized the lighting and material configuration for clarity.
•	Iteration played a major role — I refined camera movement, lighting behavior, and projection toggling step by step throughout the development milestones.
•	My approach improved over time as I became more intentional about structure, performance, and visual accuracy.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
•	Computational graphics helped me understand transformations, lighting models, and camera control — skills that apply to future interactive and visual computing coursework.
•	This project directly supports my goal of becoming a full-stack and front-end web developer, where visual clarity, interactivity, and performance all matter.
•	It helped me think more like an engineer who builds not just functionality but experiences that look and feel intentional to the user.
